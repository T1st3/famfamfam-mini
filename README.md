## About

The `Mini` icon pack, as available on [famfamfam website](http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/mini/).

All credits for these icons go to their original author: Mark James (mjames@gmail.com)

The aim of this project is to make this icon pack available through various package managers, such as:

- [NPM](https://npmjs.org)
- [Bower](http://bower.io)
- [Packagist](https://packagist.org)
- [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org)


All icons are supplied in `GIF` format.


## CSS spritesheets

You can insert the icons directly into your HTML with a common IMG tag:

```html
<img alt="Refresh" src="dist/gif/action_refresh_blue.gif" width="16" height="16">
```


In addition to the icons by themselves, this project also ships a CSS spritesheet for the icon-pack. This spritesheet allows to load the entire icon-pack in just 1 image, and thus reduce HTTP calls.

This is what it actually looks:

![Spritesheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/legacy-icons/famfamfam-mini/master/dist/sprite/famfamfam-mini.png)


All the positioning of the icons inside this alone image is made through CSS, which allows you to just add block-type tags with the proper class and get the same result:

```html
<div class="famfamfam-mini action_refresh_blue"></div>
```

Just remember to add the CSS stylesheet to the HEAD of your HTML page!


## Install

Get the package with NPM

> `npm install famfamfam-mini`


Get the package with Bower

> `bower install famfamfam-mini`


Get the package with Composer / Packagist

> `composer require legacy-icons/famfamfam-mini`


Get the package with NuGet

> `Install-Package famfamfam-mini`


## Build the whole project or your custom project

We use [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) to build the project, so if you want to re-build or customize this project, you'll need Gulp.

After gulp is installed, and your CLI is pointed to your work directory, first install the dependencies:

**with NPM 2.x.x**

> `npm install`

**with NPM 3.x.x** (resolve dependencies for `node-spritesheet` before this module's ones)

> `npm install grunt grunt-contrib-coffee grunt-contrib-clean`

> `npm install`

then be sure that you have *[ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php)* installed for building spritesheet.

then, you can run the `gulp build` task to build the project:

> `gulp build`


### What the build task does?

First, it copies `GIF` files from the `src` folder, and pastes them to the `dist` folder.

Then it creates a spritesheet from the `GIF` images located in the `src` folder, and thus creates the `sprite` folder in `dist`.

If, for example you just want `action_stop` and `page_right` icons in a spritesheet, you just have to fork this project, point your CLI to the working directory, 
empty the `src` directory, except `action_stop` and `page_right` icons in GIF format, and then run the `gulp build` task.

You'll get the proper spritesheet and copies of the icons directly in the `dist` folder.
